Kids who don’t get enough to eat begin life with a serious disadvantage. Hungry children are more likely to be hospitalized and face higher risks of health problems like anemia and asthma. As they grow up, youth struggling to get enough food are more likely to have problems in school and other social situations. United Way is fighting this problem, community by community.",
